\title{Differential analysis for Agilent array}
\usage{
anaDiff_Agilent(designPuce)
}
\arguments{
\item{designPuce}{character or integer. The Agilent number of the design}

\item{labelling}{character. The default is "direct" for a direct labelling of target.
For an indirect labelling, use "indirect".}

\item{popBH}{character. The default is "alternate" : For the BH calculation, all the 
probe non expressed and non differentiel will exclude. The other choice is "complete"
for the BH calculation on all the probes.}

\item{statBH}{character. The default is "BH". Other choice are "Bonferroni", 
"Bonferroni.with.m0" and "qvalue".}

\item{bkgCalculation}{logical. Default is TRUE. For calculation and substraction of
the background. For the background calculation, a subset of the 10 percent less expressed
probes is used for mean and standard deviation. The background is this mean plus twice
standard deviation.}

\item{plot}{logical. Default is TRUE, for generate the png quality plot.}

\item{adresse}{character. 
The default is "http://pegasus-bioinfo.angers-nantes.inra.fr/rscripts/Tools/Agilent/",
used for the specification of the design and the read of annotations file.}

\item{dataTest}{logical. Default is FALSE.}

\item{dec}{character. Default is "." as decimal separator.}
}
\value{
Summary of quality appreciations. Files are wrote on a new directory using the
summary file name.
}
\description{
Comparison analysis using limma.

This fonction read the summary file and execute the several comparison of it.
Library used are limma, httr and jsonlite.
}

\section{Prerequisites and summary file}{

The summary file must be in the same directory than raw data. It is a tabular text 
file with 7 columns and one line by array.
\subsection{FileName}{
The summary file name of the array with the barcode of the slide and the position of the 
array on the slide. ei: 258455010001_1_1
}
\subsection{Cy3}{
Name of the Cy3 sample. ei: NaCl_repet1
}
\subsection{Cy5}{
Name of the Cy5 sample. ei. H2O_2
}
\subsection{Control}{
3 or 5: the dye of the control sample (denominator for comparison)
}
\subsection{Swaps}{
Name of the comparison. Must be the same for all the array (line) composing the 
comparison. ei: NaCl_vs_H2O
}
\subsection{CtrName}{
Name of the control sample (denominator) after compilation (mean) of biological or 
thechnical repets.
}
\subsection{TtmtName}{
Name of the treated sample (numerator) after compilation (mean) of biological or 
thechnical repets.
}
